You step cautiously into the second dungeon, its cold stone walls looming high. At the very center of the chamber, a lone figure stirs — a decaying zombie, its hollow eyes locking onto you with malicious intent. The air is thick with the stench of rot, and a low growl rumbles from the creature’s throat as it shambles toward you. There's no way forward without a fight. Beyond the zombie, two exits beckon: one to the south and another to the east. But to reach them, you must first face this undead horror and defeat it to continue your journey.

What do you do?

(A) Attack
(F) Try to flee
